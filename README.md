## About

Manic Swords is an exercise project to learn React.js and improve our skills with Javascript.
We used [Feathers](http://feathersjs.com). An open source web framework for building modern real-time applications.

The game involves two players and swords falling from the sky maniacally. Avoid the swords to survive. Last man standing wins the game. Please turn on your sound!

WORK IN PROGRESS

## Main challenges

1. Dynamic drawing in HTML5 Canvas: updating each animation frame.
2. Moving players synchronously in both user screens via POST server request and Socket IO.
3. Constantly taking into account performance and how to improve it.
4. Full-stack JS application with NodeJS as Backend.
5. Authorization using Feathers.
6. Managing the data flow with React-redux.
